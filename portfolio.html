<a>For this project we had to create a game with our partner using Scratch. My partner and I decided to make a maze game with 2 stages. The game seemed too easy so we added a timer that would fail the player if it ran out, and they would would have to start over from the beginning.</a>

<a>In this exercise we created an app for a tablet that utilized the touch screen functionality of the tablet. My partner and I decided to make a very short IQ test for our project.</a>

<h3>Interactive Fiction</h3>
<a>The interactive fiction story was designed as a way to test our ability to create a story using repl.it to transition into python. Our story was a quest, where the character you control is trying to procure an internet connection, and has no limits as to how far they will go.</a>

<h7>Image Manipulation</h7>
</font>
</center>
<center>
<a>This project asked us to manipulate images on pixel level in various ways. I decided to use a stock image of the sun and change the color twice. The method I used wat to find any parts of the image that where the sum of RGB values were greater than a certain value and then change the color of those areas of the image.</a>
