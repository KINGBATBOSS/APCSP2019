<a>For this project we had to create a game with our partner using Scratch. My partner and I decided to make a maze game with 2 stages. The game seemed too easy so we added a timer that would fail the player if it ran out, and they would would have to start over from the beginning.</a>

<h2>App inventor</h2>
<a>In this exercise we created an app for a tablet that utilized the touch screen functionality of the tablet. My partner and I decided to make a very short IQ test for our project.</a>

<h3>Interactive Fiction</h3>
<a>The interactive fiction story was designed as a way to test our ability to create a story using repl.it to transition into python. Our story was a quest, where the character you control is trying to procure an internet connection, and has no limits as to how far they will go.</a>

<a>For this project, a pathfinder was made for the school of Rancho Bernardo High School. It was designed to help new students easily find their rooms and help learn more about where they will be studying.</a>

<h7>Image Manipulation</h7>
</font>
</center>
<center>
<a>This project asked us to manipulate images on pixel level in various ways. I decided to use a stock image of the sun and change the color twice. The method I used wat to find any parts of the image that where the sum of RGB values were greater than a certain value and then change the color of those areas of the image.</a>

<h8>GUI</h8>
</font>
</center>
<center>
<a>In this project we bhad to design a GUI that offered human computer interaction in order to better understand the capabilties of computers and the benfits they offer.
Once we had an idea about what wanted to do, ww got to coding the prograam. The idea was to make 2 balls bounce around the edges of the window. This was all possible due to Tkinter, which is a Python kernel that specializes in designing GUI's.</a>

<center>
<a>The purpose of this project was to answer a question using a large set of data. We had two questions answered: "What is the frequency
of the first letter of each word in the dictionary?" and "What is the percentage of words within the dictionary with a
specific length?" These two questions were answered by using repl.it to produce the graphs faster than Canopy. 
The first graph used a bar chart to best represent the number of words, and the second graph was a pie chart since we used 
percentages as our measure.</a></center>

<center><a>Our assignment with this project was to modify an existing simulation model in our own crative way. 
The model we chose to change was called Projectile Attack. The changes we made were to increase the speed of the shell fired from the tank,
change the colors of the screen, make the helicopter change height every 5 seconds for an increased challenge, and added a slider to change
 the position of the tank as long as it doesn't touch the wall.</a>
