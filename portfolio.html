<a>For this project we had to create a game with our partner using Scratch. My partner and I decided to make a maze game with 2 stages. The game seemed too easy so we added a timer that would fail the player if it ran out, and they would would have to start over from the beginning.</a>

<h4>In this exercise we created an app for a tablet that utilized the touch screen functionality of the tablet. My partner and I decided to make a very short IQ test for our project.</h4>

<h3>Interactive Fiction</h3>
<a>The interactive fiction story was designed as a way to test our ability to create a story using repl.it to transition into python. Our story was a quest, where the character you control is trying to procure an internet connection, and has no limits as to how far they will go.</a>

<h6>Python Game</h6>
</font>
<a>For this project, a pathfinder was made for the school of Rancho Bernardo High School. It was designed to help new students easily find their rooms and help learn more about where they will be studying. Unfortunately the program must be opened in repl.it itself in order for the map to generate.</a>
